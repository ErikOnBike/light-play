Resource light AirTunes player for ALAC music files.

AirTunes player aimed to play music files which are directly supported by Airport Express devices. Only ALAC files are therefore supported right now. The player requires very little memory and very little CPU-resources. Player is developed for use on small platforms like OpenWrt and/or Raspberry Pi (not tested on the Raspberry Pi). A future version might have support for AirPlay (audio) as well.

See the following blog for some more information on how the resource can be kept low.
